# RELASER code copies

## Original RELASER in Fortran

Versions 2.71, 2.72

Last edited unofficial 273 version on June 18, 2018

Future changes:
- Make user interface using Winteracter
- Implement in a modern programming language (MATLAB)

## NASH RELASER conversion to MATLAB

Version 2.72 (Fortran) to Version 1.0

Implemented by Justin Nash, with strong focus on the Walsh 2001 paper.

Issues:
- Does not correctly solve the coupled rate equations
- Does not keep track of individual processes.

## Previous RELASER conversion to MATLAB

Version 2.72 (Fortran) to Version 1.0

Developed in Summer 2018 by previous NASA intern. It is a failing mixture of original and NASHs attempt.

Issues:
- Does not correctly solve the coupled rate equations
- Does not keep track of individual processes.
- Implements some interactive components of original RELASER program.
